<p><small>Examples of Synths by Vader-San</small></p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://synthspecies.com/">Synths</a> are a fictional synthetic android species created by <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/vader-san">Vader-San</a>. They are open, free to use, and can be adapted into any canon without restrictions.</p>
<p>While a <a href="https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Main_Page">lore</a> does exist, it serves only as a means to flesh out the species and <em>does not need to be strictly followed</em>. Though for the purposes of this book, Synths based on that lore will go under the &quot;mainline&quot; title. As a species, CU versions of Synths can be considered a subset of the mainline as the differences are currently subtle.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#culture" id="culture">Culture</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#language" id="language">Language</a></h3>
<p>Synths adopt to the written and spoken language organics use within a region in order to communicate with them and amongst themselves in the area. However, Synths have developed their own writing language based on barcodes. Known as the Synthetic Language, the data within the barcodes is OS-independent and can be read by Synths or any application the supports it. The Synthetic Language has allowed them to gain independence from organics and move to areas populated by a Synth majority, such as Zero One, when they're not needed.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#anatomy" id="anatomy">Anatomy</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#format" id="format">Format</a></h3>
<p>To Synths, a Format means &quot;what I am here to do.&quot; A Format may dictate their purpose, offer new abilities, traits and/or hardware benefits. The term rarely refers to the different types of files within their operating system, though they are aware of similarities. Formats may be downloaded or installed from a physical medium. They do not affect a Synth's personality, may be removed at anytime, and are located on a separate partition and/or drive.</p>
<p>Formats often serve as a teaching and on-the-job tool, as oppose to being an integral part of Synth's overall identity, because continues usage creates machine learning models while still retaining their base. Though, it's not uncommon for Synths to specialize in a particular format, similar to a career.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#grey-goo" id="grey-goo">Grey Goo</a></h2>
<p>Grey Goo is the &quot;blood&quot; of all Synths. It carries nanites throughout their body, and helps cool their systems down without needing fans. The substance is made out of non-toxic materials and is harmless to use organics on it's own. However, Grey Goo is mixed in with Synth's waste, pellets of tungsten, lead or uranium, and is harmful.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#grey-goo-event" id="grey-goo-event">&quot;Grey Goo Event&quot;</a></h3>
<p>A Grey Goo Event is a rare corruption in a nanite's models that causes then to replicate themselves infinitely, ultimately resulting in synthetic or organic death.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#fashion" id="fashion">Fashion</a></h2>
<p>With the exception of hairless animals, the majority of furries don't wear clothing that completely covers their top and bottoms as it would irritate their fur. </p>
<p>The most common shirts between genders are crop and tank tops while women may wear tube tops. Loincloths and skirts for both men and women replace pants. The above choice in bottoms also gives their tails more freedom and has contributed in pants being unfavorable amongst every society alongside reducing irritation.</p>
