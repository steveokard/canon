Though culture naturally differs from region-to-region, somethings remain constant throughout all societies in Casey Universe, especially since the internet's rise.

## Language

The Bradford kingdom has it's own language known as [Akina](https://akina.tonybark.com/), meaning "spoken word". The language has it's own separate book, you don't have to read it, but some complex concepts will have their own word in Akina that describes it, such as their mythology.

## Mythology

Within the Bradford kingdom's folklore, Idó is a word in Akina that describes the concept in which spirits that can range from elements of the landscape, forces of nature, as well as beings and the qualities that these beings express; they can also be the spirits of venerated dead people.

*In reality, Idó is adopted from the Japanese concept of [Kami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami). While "Kami" normally translates to "Gods," the concept itself is much more involved.*
