# Culture

Though culture naturally differs from region-to-region, somethings remain constant throughout all societies in Casey Universe, especially since the internet's rise.

## Language

The Bradford kingdom has it's own language known as [Akina](https://akina.tonybark.com/), meaning "spoken word". It has it's own book, separate from this. You don't have to read it, but some complex concepts, such as their mythology and genetics, may have their own associated Akina word referenced in this book, if English doesn't have any.

## Mythology

Within the Bradford kingdom's folklore, Idó is a word in Akina that describes the concept in which spirits that can range from elements of the landscape, forces of nature, as well as beings and the qualities that these beings express; they can also be the spirits of venerated dead people.

*In reality, Idó is adopted from the Japanese concept of [Kami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami). While "Kami" normally translates to "Gods," the concept itself is much more involved.*
## Fashion

With the exception of hairless animals, the majority of furries don't wear clothing that completely covers their top and bottoms as it would irritate their fur.
