## Bradford Kingdom

The Bradford kingdom is a large and powerful kingdom founded by furry cats. It was home exclusively to cats until the kingdom opened up it's borders and allowed other furry species to live there following the end of the Great War and formation of Furtropolis. The king and queen's roles has since been reduced to signing bills passed by parliament.
