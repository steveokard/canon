## Great War

The Great War was a world war that lasted for five wars. It lead to a large shift in the balance of power and towards democracy while many nations formed unions in order to share economic and political benefits that they once fought over before the Great War. It has lead to technical advances and break through.

However, not everyone is satisfied with the outcome. Some people, including newly elected leaders of nations, wish to go back to the days before the Great War, despite the majority liking the results.
