# World

The world is recovering from a world war. It has lead to change of powers as countries start seeking to unionize in order share in trade and policies. One of them was a once cat exclusive nation, the Bradford Kingdom, located on the island continent of Odin, opening their doors to outsiders. As a consequence, the capital changed from a once dominant cat city, Catsinburg, to a new multi-species city, Furtropolis. While many welcomed the change, there is still some unrest by those yearning the old days.
