Furtropolis is the current capital city of the Bradford Kingdom that took Catsinburg's place at the end of the Great War. The city center is home to many political buildings, such as parliament, though the Bradford castle is located elsewhere.

Furtropolis is home to a diverse range of species, both organic and synthetic alike, though doesn't necessarily specialize in any one particular thing for one particular species, compared to Catsinburg, but instead provides a healthy mix of all.

## Catsinburg

Catsinburg is the second largest city in the Bradford Kingdom. It was created during the kingdom's formation and use to be capital city until Furtropolis took it's place after the Great War.

The city is not nearly as diverse as Furtropolis, consisting only of varies feline species and breeds. Despite this set back, it used this to it's advantage and specialized in feline-oriented goods and services from which Furtropolis frequently imports from.
