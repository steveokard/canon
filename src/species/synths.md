[Synths](https://synthspecies.com/) are a fictional synthetic android species created by [Vader-San](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/vader-san). They are open, free to use, and can be adapted into any canon without restrictions.

While a [lore](https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Main_Page) does exist, it serves only as a means to flesh out the species and *does not need to be strictly followed*. Though for the purposes of this book, Synths based on that lore will go under the "mainline" title. As a species, CU versions of Synths can be considered a subset of the mainline as the differences are currently subtle.
