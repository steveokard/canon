# Characters

This section has characters categorized by the ethical axis of [Character Alignment spectrum](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment), lawful vs chaotic, only to go deeper into each character's morals, good or evil, from there. As with everything in this book, treat these roles only as guidelines.
