# Characters

This section has characters split between lawful, neutral, and chaotic, with each one existing somewhere on [Character Alignment spectrum](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment) sitting somewhere between good and evil. As with everything in this book, treat these roles only as guidelines.
