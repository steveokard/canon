# Prince Oliver Bradford

Oliver is a blue tabby cat that is interested in cars, soccer, and coin collecting. Despite his Prince title, he is not in the top five list of successors to become king, as he is the sibling to one of the princess related to the king.

But Oliver has no interest in becoming king, anyway, and works to keep his prince status discrete, often to the disappointment of his parents. But his upbringing means he still has mannerisms only found within the royal family, and he likes to wear a silver necklace with a crown hanging that's not commonly worn around the greater kingdom.

Oliver likes to travel around the country in his car. He owns a home in the suburbs close to the capital city. Oliver may accidentally reveal secrets to how their family's monarch works or behaves between his friends that cause the spread of rumors.
