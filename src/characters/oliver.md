# Oliver Bradford

Oliver is a blue tabby cat that is interested in cars, soccer, and coin collecting.

Oliver descends from royalty, but he was not the first born son in his family, and not in line to be the next prince, nor does he have any wishes to become one. He likes to travel around the country and owns a home along the suburbs of the capital city. Oliver may accidentally reveal secrets to how their family's monarch behaves between his friends that cause rumors to spread.
