# Prince Oliver Bradford

Oliver is a blue tabby cat that is interested in cars, soccer, and coin collecting. Despite his Prince title, he is not in the top five list of successors to become king because his mother is one of many sibling the king has had over the years.

But Oliver has no interest in becoming king, anyway, and works to keep his prince status discrete, often to the disappointment of his parents. However, his upbringing means he still has mannerisms only found within the royal family, even though he is much more chill overall and often goes with the flow, compared to the rest. Oliver also wears a silver necklace with a certain crown hanging from it that, while not rare, isn't commonly worn around the greater kingdom. Oliver may accidentally reveal secrets to how your family's monarch works or behaves between his friends during conversation that cause the spread of rumors.
