# Oliver Bradford

Oliver is a blue tabby cat that is interested in cars, soccer, and coin collecting. He descends from royalty, but was not the first born son in his family, and not in line to be the next prince, nor does he have any wishes to become one. Oliver likes to travel around the country in his car. He owns a home in the suburbs close to the capital city. Oliver may accidentally reveal secrets to how their family's monarch behaves between his friends that cause rumors to spread.
