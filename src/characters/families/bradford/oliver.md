# Prince Oliver Bradford

Oliver is a blue tabby cat that is interested in cars, soccer, and coin collecting. He is the grandchild to the king. 

Despite his "Prince" title, he is not in the top five list of successors to become king he is one of the many grandchildren in the royal family. But Oliver has no interest in becoming king, anyway, and works to keep his prince status discrete, often to the disappointment of his parents. However, his upbringing means he still has mannerisms only found within the royal family, even though he is much more chill overall and often goes with the flow, compared to the rest. 

Oliver also wears a silver necklace with a symbol of the [Catsinburg](./../universe/locations.md#catsinburg) crown hanging from it. While others like it aren't rare, it's not commonly worn within the greater kingdom.
