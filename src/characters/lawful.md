# Lawful Characters

## Prince Oliver Bradford

Oliver is a tabby cat with blue fur. Despite his "Prince" title, he is not in the top five list of successors to become king as he is one of many grandchildren in the royal family. 

But he has no interest in becoming king, anyway, and works to keep his prince status discrete, often to the disappointment of his parents. Because of this refuel, he often wonders about the kingdom, often untended, to see what it's like on the outside and is more likely to question the laws, if they see them doing more harm than good. However, he will still use his status as royalty as means of last resort.

## Felix Casey

Felix is a purple Synth who works as a construction worker for Furtropolis. He likes to switch between male and kipomito between upgrades, lives with the Casey brothers, and has a [helperbot](https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Helperbots), Nix, that serves as his companion.

Like all Synths, Felix desires to be helpful, and naturally takes a more structured approach to life. As a consequence, he has a hard time living outside of a rule set. He feels more guilt in bending or breaking the rules, even when he knows it's the right thing to do. However, his familiarity with the rules makes him more pragmatic at times. He frequently has to give the Casey brothers a reality check, often to their own frustration.

## Savelli Cornell

Savelli Cornell is a male Dalmatian who works for the Bradford kingdom's guard and is loyal to the royal family after learning from his parents. His parents were refugees who worked their way up by doing the same. He works within the laws and uses his close ties royalty to get what he wants.

Being so close royalty meant Savelli grew up with Prince Oliver. Oliver was one of the rare few in the royal family that saw him as a friend, not a servant, and two befriended each other. He is one of the few to ever see Savelli smile.
