# Lawful Characters

## Prince Oliver Bradford

Oliver is a tabby cat with blue fur. Despite his "Prince" title, he is not in the top five list of successors to become king as he is one of many grandchildren in the royal family. 

But he has no interest in becoming king, anyway, and works to keep his prince status discrete, often to the disappointment of his parents. Because of this refuel, he often wonders about the kingdom, often untended, to see what it's like on the outside and is more likely to question the laws, if they see them doing more harm than good. However, he will still use his status as royalty as means of last resort.

## Savelli Cornell

Nearing the end Great War, Savelli's parents moved to the Bradford kingdom as refugees. By remaining kind to the royal family, his parents were able to work for the guard. Learning from his parents, Savelli saw the law as a means to an end, regardless of the consequences it may bring.

Being so close royalty, Savelli grew up with Prince Oliver. Oliver was one of the rare few in the royal family that saw him as a friend, not a servant, and two genuinely befriended each other. He is one of the few to ever see Savelli smile.
