# Lawful Characters

## Prince Oliver Bradford

Oliver is a tabby cat with blue fur. Despite his "Prince" title, he is not in the top five list of successors to become king as he is one of many grandchildren in the royal family. 

But he has no interest in becoming king, anyway, and works to keep his prince status discrete, often to the disappointment of his parents. Because of this refuel, he often wonders about the kingdom, often untended, to see what it's like on the outside and is more likely to question the laws, if they see them doing more harm than good. However, he will still use his status as royalty as means of last resort.

## Savelli Cornell

Nearing the end Great War, Savelli's parents, dalmatians from a far away land, washed up on the shores of the Bradford kingdom and became refugees. By remaining kind to the royal family, his parents were able to work for the guard. Learning from his parents, Savelli saw working within the law and remaining loyal to the royal family as a means getting what he wants.

Being so close royalty meant Savelli grew up with Prince Oliver. Oliver was one of the rare few in the royal family that saw him as a friend, not a servant, and two befriended each other. He is one of the few to ever see Savelli smile.
