## Prince Oliver Bradford

Oliver is a tabby cat with blue fur. Despite his "Prince" title, he is not in the top five list of successors to become king as he is one of many grandchildren in the royal family.

Despite his lack of enthusiasm on being future king, Oliver's upbringing means he believes in order and discipline as the best way to achieve good in the world. As a consequence, while Oliver is a well-intended and king hearted person, he is more likely to side with the police and courts, who may not share his same vision despite their corporation due to his status.
