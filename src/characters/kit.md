# Kit Welsh

Kit is a raccoon. He likes astronomy, amateur radio and video editing. Kit is an [andromorph](../universe/andromorph.md) but his preference towards modest clothing makes this naturally discrete.

Kit believes in truth and justice along with a code of conduct. This often gets him involved in investigative journalism. He occasionally winds up at odds with the police who sometimes question his interpretations of the law. The majority of his interpretations are correct but the rare instances he messes up usually wind up getting him trouble with the very laws he tries to help enforce. Kit sometimes used as a scapegoat for the police and politicians when those situations occur.
