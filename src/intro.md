# Introduction

Casey Universe, or simply "CU," is my fictional universe that's open and free to use for anyone to participate or adapt. The canon can be treated as simply guidelines, and the multiverse can be used for creating unofficial variants.

Do I expect fan fiction? No. Am I going to preemptively allow and appreciate both, regardless? Yes. I have better things to worry about than stamping approval on work that while, yes, you may have my characters in, it is still *your* work. Hell, your ideas may be better than mine.

## Synopsis

The world is recovering from a world war. It has lead to change of powers as start countries seeking to unionize in order share in trade and policies. One of them was a once cat exclusive nation, the Bradford Kingdom, opening their doors to outsiders. As a consequence, the capital changed from a once dominant cat city, Catsinburg, to a new multi-species city, Furtropolis. While many welcomed the change, there is still some unrest by those yearning the old days.
