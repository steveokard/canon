# Introduction

Casey Universe, or simply "CU," is my fictional universe that's open and free to use for anyone to participate or adapt. The canon can be treated as simply guidelines, and the multiverse can be used for creating unofficial variants.

Do I expect fan fiction, let alone ones that deviate from the canon so much they might as well be their own original characters and/or world? No. Am I going to prematurely allow and appreciate both, regardless? Yes. I have better things to worry about than stamping approval on work that while, yes, may have my characters is still your work. Hell, your ideas may be better than mine.
