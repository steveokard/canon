# Mutates

Mutates are furries with monster-like traits. This can range from [tailmaws](./tailmaw.md) to back tentacles. Mutates covers the bulk of genetics in Casey Universe, with the exception of [Andromorphs](andromorph.md). However, they are relatively recent addition and are more common in [alternate universes](./../multiverse.md) than the primary, [for the time being](./README.md).
