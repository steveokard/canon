# Mutates

Mutates are furries with monster-like traits. This can range from [tailmaws](./tailmaw.md) to back tentacles, but **does not** include [Andromorphs](andromorph.md). Mutates are relatively recent addition to Casey Universe and are more common in [alternate universes](./../multiverse.md) than the primary, [for the time being](./README.md#gene-splicing).
