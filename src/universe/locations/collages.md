# Collages

## Furtropolis

Furtropolis is home to two major collages: Riverbank Technical University and the University of Bradford. Though both collages share similar courses, they specialize in different areas.

### Riverbank Technical University

Along the coastal area is Riverbank Technical University. As the name describes, the collage specializes in technology and science with degrees in Computer Science, Physics, Economics, Biology and Psychology.

### University of Bradford

Closer to the city center is University of Bradford. It is the oldest collage in Furtropolis, though not overall within the kingdom, it specializes in fine arts such as commutations, culinary arts, drama, language, and literature - though, the latter two are combined.
