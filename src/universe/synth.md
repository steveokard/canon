[Synths](https://synthspecies.com/) are a fictional synthetic android species created by [Vader-San](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/vader-san). They are open, free to use, and can be adapted into any canon without restrictions.

While a [lore](https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Main_Page) does exist, it serves only as a means to flesh out the species and *does not need to be strictly followed*. Though for the purposes of this book, Synths based on that lore will go under the "mainline" title. Casey Universe versions generally follow the mainline when it comes to their [anatomy](https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Anatomy), with the exception of software, and mainly differ in culture.

## Culture
### Language

Synths adopt to the written and spoken language organics use within a region in order to communicate with them and amongst themselves in the area. However, Synths have developed their own writing language based on barcodes. Known as the Synthetic Language, the data within the barcodes is OS-independent and can be read by Synths or any application the supports the format. The Synthetic Language has allowed them to gain independence from organics and move to areas populated by a Synth majority, such as Zero One.

### Work

Synths commonly take on jobs that organics would not be fit for. Their modular nature makes it easier for them to adapt to extreme or hostile environments. Though, they've also taken on jobs in less exciting but still crucial roles such as long distance transportation for both passengers and freight, where AI would still be beneficial but the cost of a centralized system, similar to those in rapid transit, would be impractical. Synths working in long distance transport are more likely to be multicultural.

## Anatomy
### Formats

To Synths, a Format means "what I am here to do." A Format dictates their purpose, offers additional traits and hardware benefits, the term rarely refers to the different types of files within their operating system. Formats may be downloaded or installed from a physical medium. They do not affect a Synth's personality, may be removed at anytime, and are located on a separate partition and/or drive. Even though Formats do not affect their personality, Synths will still gain long term knowledge and experience from continues usage. For this reason, Formats often serve as a teaching or on-the-job tool, as oppose to being an integral part of their identity.
