# Synths

The [Synths](https://synthspecies.com/) are a fictional synthetic android species created by [Vader-San](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/vader-san). They are open, free to use, and can be adapted into any canon without restrictions.

While a [lore](https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Main_Page) does exist, it serves only as a means to flesh out the species and *does not need to be strictly followed*. For the purpose of this book, however, Synths based on that lore will be known as "mainline Synths." The CU versions follow the mainline.

## Culture

### Language

Synths adopt to the written and spoken language organics use within a region in order to communicate with them and amongst themselves in the area. However, Synths have developed their own writing language based on barcodes. Known as the Synthetic Language, the data within the barcodes is OS-independent and can be read by Synths or any application the supports the format. The Synthetic Language has allowed them to gain independence from organics and move to areas populated by them, such as Zero One, for when they're not needed.

## Anatomy
### Genitals

As androids, Synths are naturally genderless. Though they are capable of assuming the role of male or female, or anywhere in between, with the appropriate module, if they choose to.

However, in order to maintain their internal "organs," they are required to eat, just like organics. Not all materials can be recycled, though, and need to be extracted. Synths have a singular slit between them for extracting materials that can't be stored or recycled.
