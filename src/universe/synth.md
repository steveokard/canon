[Synths](https://synthspecies.com/) are a fictional synthetic android species created by [Vader-San](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/vader-san). They are open, free to use, and can be adapted into any canon without restrictions.

While a [lore](https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Main_Page) does exist, it serves only as a means to flesh out the species and *does not need to be strictly followed*. Though Synths based on that lore will go under the "mainline" title for the purpose of this book. CU versions follow the mainline when it comes to their [autonomy](https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Anatomy) and differ only in culture.
## Culture

### Language

Synths adopt to the written and spoken language organics use within a region in order to communicate with them and amongst themselves in the area. However, Synths have developed their own writing language based on barcodes. Known as the Synthetic Language, the data within the barcodes is OS-independent and can be read by Synths or any application the supports the format. The Synthetic Language has allowed them to gain independence from organics and move to areas populated by them, such as Zero One, for when they're not needed.
