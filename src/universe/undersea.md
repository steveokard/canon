# Undersea Life

Life undersea is the most unique and exotic portion of Casey Universe.

## Relationship with land

Communication between land and sea is maintained by mammals capable of living in both environments, such as Otters. Freight is sent to or from hubs that meet at an interchange point for transferring cargo from land to sea or vice versa.

## Culture

### Beach

Undersea creatures living closer to beaches or docks, for example, tend to inherent a mix of cultural norms from both land and sea. For example, sea creatures living closer to land are more likely to wear full body clothing wherein loincloths are more common further out at sea.
