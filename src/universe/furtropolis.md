The city contains a tall tower in the middle, known as the Central Tower, which is home of the mayor, town hall and the city's railroad terminal for long distance trains. The commercial distracts wraps around the Central Tower in all directions. The residential distracts wraps around the commercial distracts in a similar fashion.
