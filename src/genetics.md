## amitoju/kipomito

In Akina, *kipomito* literally means "male with female genitals" and *amitoju* means the reverse, "female with male genitals". With *ami* and *kipo* behaving as root words that mean "female" and "male", respectfully.

The closet equivalent, without being blunt, is Gynomorphs and Andromorphs, but the these words don't do Casey Universe justice because they literally mean mimicking characteristics of respective opposite sex wherein amitoju and kipomito specially refer to only the reproductive portions.
