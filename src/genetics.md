## amitoju/kipomito

In Akina, "kipomito" literally means *"male with female genitals"* and "amitoju" means the reverse, *"female with male genitals"*. The closet equivalent, without being blunt, is Andromorphs and Gynomorphs, respectfully, but the these words means mimicking characteristics of respective opposite sex. However, in Casey Universe characters with these traits are **not** mimics and are physically a blend of both. This is the only case in which language is important because there is no other way to describe in English without being blunt.
