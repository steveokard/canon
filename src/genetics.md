## amitoju/kipomito

In Akina, *kipomito* and *amitoju* are pronouns that literally means "male with female genitals" and "female with male genitals," respectfully. With *ami* and *kipo* behaving as root words that mean "female" and "male", respectfully.

The closet equivalent, without being blunt, is Gynomorphs and Andromorphs, but the these words don't do Casey Universe justice because they literally mean mimicking characteristics of respective opposite sex. Wherein amitoju and kipomito specially refers to the having the physical reproductive traits of the opposite sex, born or surgical. These words are especially useful for Synths, due to their modular nature.
